# AsteroidsGame
Asteroids is a space-themed multidirectional shooter arcade video game designed by Lyle Rains and Ed Logg released in November 1979 by Atari, Inc. The player controls a single spaceship in an asteroid field. The object of the game is to shoot and destroy the asteroids, while not colliding with either. The game becomes harder as the number of asteroids increases.

 * There are 3 sizes of asteroids  (large, medium and small).
 * Upon reaching the largest asteroid splits into two of the smaller size.
 * When the player is hit by an asteroid, he loses a ship. He gains 3 seconds without being able to be hit again.
 * The game starts with 5 large asteroid initials in random places.
 * When asteroid, ship or bullet has hit the borders of the screen, it is wrapped.
 * The player has unlimited bullets.
 * When starting the game, the player has, in addition to the current ship, 3 more ships.
